            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my professional journey into the world of the Windows kernal and all its goodies, currently documenting the Native APIs and learning assembly. My name is The Bit Head, and I am a dedicated computer engineering student with a passion for low-end system development.</p>
            <p>This website is a personal project designed to help me, and hopefully others, stay motivated and engaged in learning about the Win kernal. It serves as a platform to document my progress, share knowledge, and connect with like-minded individuals.</p>
            <p>As I delve deeper into the complexities of system-level programming, I aim to create comprehensive documentation, insightful articles, and practical examples. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, I hope this site will provide valuable resources and inspiration.</p>
